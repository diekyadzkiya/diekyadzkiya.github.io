  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the reduction of unstable systems. Suppose we have a large-scale unstable system. The reduction of such systems are done in order to obtain a simpler model that has a similar behavior with the original model. In reality, a higher order model is not preferred because the computation takes more time. Thus we need a method to reduce the order of a model that is known as model reduction. Model reduction of a system is the method of approximation of a system with a lower order but the dynamic behavior is equal or almost equal to the original model. In this paper, we discuss model reduction of unstable systems. Finally this method is applied to shallow water equation that describes the flow of water in rivers: we obtain a procedure for model reduction of unstable systems and the reduced model of shallow water equations.}

  journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
  abstract = {In this paper, we study the identification of variables on a model reduction process and estimation of variables on reduced system. We aim to relate variables on reduced and original system, so that we can compare the estimation accuracy of the original system and reduced system. As such, the objective of this paper is to discuss identification and estimation of variables on reduced model. First, model order reduction is done by using balanced truncation method. This process begins with the construction of balanced system. After that, we identify the relationship between variables of the balanced system and the original system. Then, we eliminate variables of the balanced system that have a small influence on the system. Furthermore, we estimate state variables on the original system and reduced system using a Kalman Filter algorithm. Finally, we compare the estimation result of the identified reduced and original system.}

  pages={003581-003588},
  abstract={This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control problem for a class of discrete event systems, namely stochastic max-plus linear systems, which are of wide practical interest as they appear in many application domains for timing and synchronization studies. The objective of the control problem is to minimize a cost function under constraints on states, inputs and outputs of such a system in a receding horizon fashion. In contrast to the pessimistic view of the robust approach on uncertainty, the stochastic approach interprets the constraints probabilistically, allowing for a sufficiently small violation probability level. In order to address the resulting nonconvex chance-constrained optimization problem, we present two ideas in this paper. First, we employ a scenario-based approach to approximate the problem solution, which optimizes the control inputs over a receding horizon, subject to the constraint satisfaction under a finite number of scenarios of the uncertain parameters. Second, we show that this approximate optimization problem is convex with respect to the decision variables and we provide a-priori probabilistic guarantees for the desired level of constraint fulfillment. The proposed scheme improves the results in the literature in two distinct directions: we do not require any assumption on the underlying probability distribution of the system parameters; and the scheme is applicable to high dimensional problems, which makes it suitable for real industrial applications. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a two-dimensional production system and it is also applied to a subset of the Dutch railway network in order to show its scalability and study its limitations.},

  abstract={In this paper, the problem of scheduling event-triggered networked control systems sharing a communication channel is addressed. Event-triggered control strategies effectively reduce the usage of resources in the implementation of control loops, in particular communication bandwidth. However, there is a lack of a well-established framework to analyze their corresponding communication load and synthesize schedulers. We focus on the case of linear-time-invariant plants and propose a procedure to build a timed automaton that captures the sampling behavior of each event-triggered controller. We show that these timed automata approximately simulate the controllers' sampling behavior. Finally, a conflict-free scheduling policy is synthesized using timed game automata to guarantee reliable communication in the network.},

  abstract={This work investigates the use of finite abstractions to study the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance problem over Stochastic Max-Plus-Linear (SMPL) systems. SMPL systems are probabilistic extensions of discrete-event MPL systems that are widely employed in the engineering practice for timing and synchronisation studies. We construct finite abstractions by re-formulating the SMPL system as a discrete-time Markov process, then tailoring formal abstraction techniques in the literature to generate a finite-state Markov Chain (MC), together with precise guarantees on the level of the introduced approximation. This finally allows to probabilistically model check the obtained MC against the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance specification. The approach is practically implemented via a dedicated software, and elucidated in this work over numerical examples.},

We show that, in both cases, the computation can be done exactly via manipulations of difference-bound matrices.

  abstract={This work discusses the computation of forward reachability for autonomous (that is, deterministic) Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) systems, a class of continuous-space discrete-event models that are relevant for applications dealing with synchronization and scheduling. Given an MPL model and a set of initial states, we characterize and compute its ``reach tube,'' namely the sequential collection of the sets of reachable states (these sets are regarded step-wise as ``reach sets''). We show that the exact computation of the reach sets can be quickly and compactly performed by manipulations of difference-bound matrices, and derive explicit worst-case bounds for the complexity of these operations. The concepts and techniques are implemented within the toolbox VeriSiMPL, and are practically elucidated by a running example. We further display the computational performance of the approach by two concluding numerical benchmarks: the technique comfortably handles reachability computations over twenty-dimensional MPL models (i.e., models with twenty continuous variables), and it clearly outperforms an alternative state-of-the-art approach in the literature.},

  abstract={VeriSiMPL (``very simple'') is a software tool to obtain finite abstractions of Max-Plus-Linear (MPL) models. MPL models (Sect. 2), specified in MATLAB, are abstracted to Labeled Transition Systems (LTS). The LTS abstraction is formally put in relationship with the concrete MPL model via a (bi)simulation relation. The abstraction procedure (Sect. 3) runs in MATLAB and leverages sparse representations, fast manipulations based on vector calculus, and optimized data structures such as Difference-Bound Matrices. LTS abstractions can be exported to structures defined in the PROMELA. This enables the verification of MPL models against temporal specifications within the SPIN model checker (Sect. 4).

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
