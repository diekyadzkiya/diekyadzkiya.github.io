    abstract = {This paper studies the boundary layer flow of unsteady incompressible and viscous fluid passing over a porous sphere with forced convection. The non-magnetic viscous fluid was induced by magnetic field of the magnetic porous sphere and it becomes Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) viscous fluid. The dimensional governing equations are developed from continuity equation, momentum equation, and energy equation. Thus, the governing equations are transformed into boundary layer equations. The boundary layer equations are further converted into non-similar boundary layer and solved numerically by using the Keller-Box method. The outcomes of this research are the effect of magnetic parameter, convection parameter, Prandtl number, porosity parameter, and permeability parameter towards velocity and temperature profiles. When magnetic parameter, convection parameter, and porosity parameter increase and permeability parameter decreases, the velocity profiles increase while the temperature profiles decrease. As an addition, the increment of Prandtl number does not affect the velocity profiles significantly.},

    abstract = {Research about fluid flow was very interesting because have a lot of advantages and it can be applied in many aspects of life. The study on fluid flow which is now widely studied is on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD). Magnetohydrodynamic is a conductive and electrical in a magnetic field. This paper considers the effect of unsteady magnetic fields on the flow of magneto-hydrodynamic fluid on the boundary layer that flows past a sphere in micropolar fluid influenced by magnetic field. Our approach is as follows. First, we construct a mathematical model and then the system of equations obtained will be solved numerically using the Keller-Box scheme. Then the system is simulated to assess its effect on the fluid flow velocity profile and the profile of microrotation particles. The result of this research indicates, that when the magnetic parameters increase, then velocity profile increases. If material parameters increase, then velocity profile decreases and magnetic parameters increase for n = 0. For n = 0.5, if magnetic parameters increase, then microrotation profile decreases.},

The development of this fUter algorithm can solve the three-dimensional radar tracking problem by using some measurement data. In the case discussed in this paper, the target is measured by radar with distance r, azimuth angle Θ, and the elevation angle φ. Notice that the data is not a linear measurement data. Thus, to address the nonlinearities inherent in the system model and the measurement model, we use the Extended Kalman FUter approach. Variables and parameters are adjusted directly on the three-dimensional radar system. The simulation results show that the proposed formulation is very effective in the calculation of nonlinear measurement with the error belongs to interval from 0.69% to 1.21%.},

  abstract={In the natural phenomenon, many systems are unstable. Moreover, the systems in the universe often have large order. The system that has a large order is more complicated than the system that has a small order. Therefore, we need to simplify the order of the system without any significant errors. Simplification of the system can be done using the reduction of the model. Model reduction can only be done on the stable system, so that the unstable system needs to be decomposed to obtain a stable subsystem that can be reduced. Singular Perturbation Approximation (SPA) method is one of the model reduction method. The reduced models are obtained by taking the speed of fast mode equal to zero. According to our simulation result using MATLAB, for reduced model having a small order (many state variables are removed) in low frequency, the model reduced using SPA is closer to original model compared with the model reduced using Balanced Truncation (BT). The time needed to simulate the reduced model is smaller than the time needed to simulate the original model. However, when the order of reduced model is small, then the error is big.},

The reduction of such systems are done in order to obtain a simpler model that has a similar behavior with the original model. In reality, a higher order model is not preferred because the computation takes more time. Thus we need a method to reduce the order of a model that is known as model reduction. Model reduction of a system is the method of approximation of a system with a lower order but the dynamic behavior is equal or almost equal to the original model. In this paper, we discuss model reduction of unstable systems. Finally this method is applied to shallow water equation that describes the flow of water in rivers: we obtain a procedure for model reduction of unstable systems and the reduced model of shallow water equations.}

  abstract={This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control problem for a class of discrete event systems, namely stochastic max-plus linear systems, which are of wide practical interest as they appear in many application domains for timing and synchronization studies. The objective of the control problem is to minimize a cost function under constraints on states, inputs and outputs of such a system in a receding horizon fashion. In contrast to the pessimistic view of the robust approach on uncertainty, the stochastic approach interprets the constraints probabilistically, allowing for a sufficiently small violation probability level. In order to address the resulting nonconvex chance-constrained optimization problem, we present two ideas in this paper. First, we employ a scenario-based approach to approximate the problem solution, which optimizes the control inputs over a receding horizon, subject to the constraint satisfaction under a finite number of scenarios of the uncertain parameters. Second, we show that this approximate optimization problem is convex with respect to the decision variables and we provide a-priori probabilistic guarantees for the desired level of constraint fulfillment. The proposed scheme improves the results in the literature in two distinct directions: we do not require any assumption on the underlying probability distribution of the system parameters; and the scheme is applicable to high dimensional problems, which makes it suitable for real industrial applications. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a two-dimensional production system and it is also applied to a subset of the Dutch railway network in order to show its scalability and study its limitations.},

Event-triggered control strategies effectively reduce the usage of resources in the implementation of control loops, in particular communication bandwidth. However, there is a lack of a well-established framework to analyze their corresponding communication load and synthesize schedulers. We focus on the case of linear-time-invariant plants and propose a procedure to build a timed automaton that captures the sampling behavior of each event-triggered controller. We show that these timed automata approximately simulate the controllers' sampling behavior. Finally, a conflict-free scheduling policy is synthesized using timed game automata to guarantee reliable communication in the network.},

This finally allows to probabilistically model check the obtained MC against the finite-horizon probabilistic invariance specification.

Given an MPL model and a set of initial states, we characterize and compute its ``reach tube,'' namely the sequential collection of the sets of reachable states (these sets are regarded step-wise as ``reach sets''). We show that the exact computation of the reach sets can be quickly and compactly performed by manipulations of difference-bound matrices, and derive explicit worst-case bounds for the complexity of these operations. The concepts and techniques are implemented within the toolbox VeriSiMPL, and are practically elucidated by a running example. We further display the computational performance of the approach by two concluding numerical benchmarks: the technique comfortably handles reachability computations over twenty-dimensional MPL models (i.e., models with twenty continuous variables), and it clearly outperforms an alternative state-of-the-art approach in the literature.},
